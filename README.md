# AI_Image_Generator
An LWC that returns an image from a prompt insert area.  

The code in this repo demonstrates a simple way of generating and returning images from OpenAI's image generation tool. 

The API Key will need to be replaced with your live API key. 

The UI has room for improvement in the 2.0
